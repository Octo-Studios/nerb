This mod was created for only one simple purpose - completely remove recipe book from the game.  
However, unlike other similar mods, this one does not just hide the recipe book button.  
NotEnoughRecipeBook completely removes its functionality.  
As a result, we not only get rid of an unnecessary UI element and annoying pop-up messages, but also significantly reduce the size of the player data file, which speeds up the process of connecting to the world and general data sync.
